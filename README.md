# Vehicle_Counting
Vehicle detection and counting are becoming increasingly important in the
field of highway management. However, due to the different sizes of vehicles,
their detection remains a challenge that directly affects the accuracy of vehicle
counts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based vehicle
detection and counting system. A new high definition highway vehicle dataset
with a total of 57,290 annotated instances in 11,129 images is published in this
study. Compared with the existing public datasets, the proposed dataset
contains annotated tiny objects in the image, which provides the complete
data foundation for vehicle detection based on deep learning. In the proposed
vehicle detection and counting system, the highway road surface in the image
is first extracted and divided into a remote area and a proximal area by a newly
proposed segmentation method; the method is crucial for improving vehicle
detection. Then, the above two areas are placed into the YOLOv3 network to
detect the type and location of the vehicle. Finally, the vehicle trajectories are
obtained by the ORB algorithm, which can be used to judge the driving
direction of the vehicle and obtain the number of different vehicles. Several
highway surveillance videos based on different scenes are used to verify the
proposed methods. The experimental results verify that using the proposed
segmentation method can provide higher detection accuracy, especially for the
detection of small vehicle objects. Moreover, the novel strategy described in
this article performs notably well in judging driving direction and counting
vehicles. This paper has general practical significance for the management and
control of highway scenes.


Here are some of the **key features** of vehicle detection software:
1) Detect and classify vehicles without making physical contact with them
2) The ability to accurately track a large number and wide variety of vehicles
3) Compile collected data and sync it to other devices
4) Process the data and analyze it to generate an accurate image of traffic flow in
a specified area
5) Vehicle counting software enables traffic to flow with ease and efficiency by
generating an accurate image of traffic flow throughout the day. This can be
used to predict any blockages or bottlenecks in the traffic, which allows people
to avoid that route, preventing overcrowding and any potential accidents that
can be caused due to it.
6) Along with this, the software also runs deep analytics on the data it has
gathered that compiles the number and type of accidents in an area so that
local authorities can work to overcome any weak links that may create hazards
leading to these accidents.

**Description:**
1) The model should be able to handle real-time video input from cameras
installed at strategic locations, utilizing advanced object detection and
tracking techniques to identify and count vehicles. It should accurately
detect and track vehicles throughout their journey from entry to exit,
regardless of their size, color, or speed.
2) The model should also be resilient to common challenges, such as
occlusions, overlapping vehicles, changing lighting conditions, and
occluded license plates. Additionally, it should minimize false positives
and negatives, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
3) The developed vehicle counting model will find applications in traffic
management, urban planning, parking management, transportation
infrastructure optimization, and future mobility planning
